# `Cloudstream3 Plugin Repo Template`

Template for a [Cloudstream3](https://github.com/recloudstream) plugin repo

**⚠️ Make sure you check "Include all branches" when using this template**

 
## Getting started with writing your first plugin

This template includes 1 example plugin.

1. Open the root build.gradle.kts, read the comments and replace all the placeholders
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure. Most files are commented
3. Build or deploy your first plugin using:
   - Windows: `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:make` or `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`
   - Linux & Mac: `./gradlew ExampleProvider:make` or `./gradlew ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`
